# Abandoned Object Detection 

## Problem Statement - 

This project was built to detect all the abandoned or unattended objects (mainly bags) in crowded areas through cctv/surveillance footage.
The classes were divided into 3 categories of bags namely 1) backpack, 2) handbag, 3) suitcase and a separate class  4) person.

## Dataset -

The dataset was curated from different sources such as youtube, roboflow.com, and a public dataset named ABODA through github.
Frames were extracted from the videos and then annotated individually. Each frame had several instances of each of the 4 classes.
The original images annotated were 3,500 and after augmentation the total number became 10,000.

## Training and Algorithm - 

We trained the images on the model yolov8m (m for medium size) and the training validation accuracy reached around 70% percent.
Then we had to track the objects in the video to identify each individual object, for this we added deep-sort object tracking algorithm.

Then comes the part where we had to detect when an object is abandoned.
The conditions for this are-
The nearest person to a bag should stray away from the bag at a distance more that the height of that person.
The object must not be moving and should be stationary.

## Testing and Improvements -

We tested the project on some videos and noticed the model is performing very well on scenes that are not heavily crowded and where range of the cctv is close-medium (the footage does not cover a large area), but struggles to detect some bags in a crowded or dim lit scene
To further improve upon this, more data needs to be curated and annotated precisely to cover a variety of situations for the model to be trained on.
Also we need to do hyperparameter tuning, so that the model generalizes better.
